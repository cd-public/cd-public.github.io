# Need an adviser?

- Send an email:

```{.email}
registrar@willamette.edu, ckdeutschbein@willamette.edu
```

```{.email}
Dear Registrar,

I am writing to formally declare my intent to major in [Computer Science and/or Data Science]. My seven-digit student ID number is [Your Student ID Number].

I have also copied my prospective advisor, Prof. Calvin, at ckdeutschbein@willamette.edu, who has offered to be my in-major adviser.

Please let me know if there are any additional steps or requirements I need to complete to formalize my major declaration.

Thank you for your time and support.

Sincerely,

[Your Preferred Name]
```

# Summaries

## CS majors

- Take CS 152 as soon as possible.
- Take DATA 351 earlier to help with internships.
- Take MATH 251W sometime next year, but not necessarily fall.
    * If you are interested in the new, post-2025 BS CS for ABET (engineering/technology) accreditation, also take CS 280 and some math.
