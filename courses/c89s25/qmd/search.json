/* htonl */\n#include &lt;endian.h&gt; /* htobe32 */\n\nuint32_t my_htonl(uint32_t n) {\n    return n;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    uint32_t test = 0x1234ABCD;\n    printf(\"%08X\\n%08X\\n%08X\\n\",\n           test,\n           htonl(test),\n           htobe32(test),\n           my_htonl(test)\n          );\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nWe will now step through an example solution to my_htonl.\nWe will leave as an exercise htonll - the 64 bit variant.\nYou can compare against the htobe64 from endian.h\n\nNot using htobe64 is not just a learning goal.\nRemoving endian.h from my code sped it up 5x in testing.\n\nI note I will assume the “host” is litte endian.\n\nIt is trivial to check, and you may do so, or use a #define\n\n\n\n\nMemory\n\nThe core insight of endianness is that it refers to bits in memory.\nRecall we have used the notion of memory a few times:\n\nStrings in C are characters in adjacent memory locations.\nBitwise operations act on bits in adjacent memory locations.\nThe star * operator and array notation [n] are similar.\n\nWe will rearrange bits using a novel operator - &, which negates *.\n\n\n\nInitial State\n\nWe begin with the indentity operation on uint32_t.\n\nuint32_t my_htonl(uint32_t n) {\n    return n;\n}\n\n\nVariables\n\nIn C89 compliance, we first declare variables.\nFirst is an alias for n.\n\nWe will treat the 32 bit int as an array of 8 bit ints.\nAn 8 bit int is of type uint8_t\nAn array is of type *\n\nWe initialize it to no value, for now.\n\nuint32_t my_htonl(uint32_t n) {\n    uint8_t *alias;\n    return n;\n}\n\nWe will also be swapping bits around.\nIn Python we can use multiple assignment\n\nx, y = y, x\n\nThis only works with key-value pairs, not arrays.\nWe use a swapping variable, a la\n\nt : int\nt = x\nx = y\ny = x\ndel t\n\nIn C:\n\nuint32_t my_htonl(uint32_t n) {\n    uint8_t swap, *alias;\n    return n;\n}\n\nWe will be looping over something that is quite like an array, so we need an index variable.\n\nI create this variable of type size_t because:\n\nWe will compare it to a sizeof\nWe will use it as an array index to denote memory locations.\nSo the C implementation will guarantee size_t is appropriate for array indices.\n\nuint32_t my_htonl(uint32_t n) {\nuint8_t swap, *alias;\nsize_t index;\nreturn n;\n}\n\n\n\n\nAmpersand\n\nWe will now use the ampersand & operator.\n\nWe want the uint8_t * array alias to refer to the same bits and the uint32_t numerical value n.\nThe location of the bits that constitute n in memory is given by &n.\nSo we set the alias equal to that location.\n\nuint32_t my_htonl(uint32_t n) {\n  uint8_t swap, *alias = &n;\n  size_t index;\n  return n;\n}\nIf you are confused at all, you should stop and print out, minimally:\n\nThe values of the star, amperand, and unmodified alias and n variables.\nAnything else you think of.\nYou should do these all in different lines in case you get an error.\nYou should think of the &n as the key of n in the key-value memory storage of the system.\n\n\n\n\nCasting\n\nWhen I run this code, I get this warning:\n\nendian.c: In function ‘my_htonl’:\nendian.c:15:26: warning: initialization of ‘uint8_t *’ {aka ‘unsigned char *’} from incompatible pointer type ‘uint32_t *’ {aka ‘unsigned int *’} [-Wincompatible-pointer-types]\n   15 |     uint8_t swap, *arr = &n;\n      |        \n\nThat’s a good warning, I am doing something extremely sketchy.\n\nAfter all, I told gcc that n was a 32 bit integer.\nThen I told it that the the location n was in held an array of 8 bit integers.\nThose things can’t both be true.\n\nWe assure gcc that we know what we are doing with a cast\n\nWe apply a cast to a value, like the value of the memory location of n\nA cast is a type name in parenthesis as a prefix.\nA cast assures the compiler of the intentionality of this mapping of bits to variable names.\nWe are claiming we want to regard n as an array of 8 bit integers, as a uint8_t *.\n\nSo:\n\nuint32_t my_htonl(uint32_t n) {\n    uint8_t swap, *alias = (uint8_t *)&n;\n    size_t index;\n    return n;\n}\n\nThis silenced all my gcc warnings and errors.\n\n\n\nMain loop\n\nIt now suffices to rearrange the bits within 32 bit integer n\nHelpfully, we can refer to these bits using the aliasing 8 bit integer array alias.\n\nuint32_t my_htonl(uint32_t n) {\n    uint8_t swap, *alias = (uint8_t *)&n;\n    size_t index;\n    swap = alias[0];\n    alias[0] = alias[3];\n    alias[3] = swap;\n    swap = alias[1];\n    alias[1] = alias[2];\n    alias[2] = swap;\n    return n;\n}\n\nYou will not this contains repeated code, and is therefore de facto wrong, though it runs correctly."

responsibility\n\nYou will create a solution in C as an “enigma.c” file\nYou will create a Gist with an “enigma.c”\nYou will email me, from your credentialed school email, the url of your Gist, it will look something like:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/cd-public/a840e95e71ac7309a53ab0bb1282ba40\nWhat follows is reference material to prepare you to implement “enigma.c”\n\nEnigma, Solved, Visual, and Rotors form a description of the requirements\nTester documents the autograder\nOther headings cover the technical details that support the implementation.\n\n\n\n\nTopic Areas\n\n\n\nReview:\nNewish:\n\n\n\n\n- podman\n- curl\n\n\n- vim\n- stdio\n\n\n- gcc\n- ciphers\n\n\n- git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotivation\n\nEnigma was a historically significant technology\n\nIt was a Nazi encryption device, using ciphers\nIt was broken by Turing, gay icon and one of the first and greatest computer scientists\n\nAt Willamette, Enigma is an (in)famous CS 151 Intro to Programming assignment\n\nBasically it is the first assignment that requires nested for loops\n\nIn this course, Enigma will demonstrate the obscurity/clarity divide\n\nIn Python, letters and numbers are different things\nIn C, there are no letters or really numbers, just bits and bytes\nThis makes Enigma in C easier, despite being a “harder” language.\n\n\n\n\nReference Materials\n\nYou can review the Python assignment if you wish:\n\nWrite-ups:\n\nProf. Roberts\nProf. Rembold\nProf. Calvin\n\nSlides\n\nProf. Rembold\nProf. Calvin\n\nAssignment Repository\n\nI also provide\n\n“Solved”: A Python implementation of the machine\n“Visual”: A text visualizer of the Engima machine’s ciphers\n“Rotors”: A text visualizer of the full Enigma machine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolved Show\n\n\nHere is a reference solution, with a few tests, in Python.\n\nGist\n\nI regard this code as considerably easier to read, test, and understand than most plaintext descriptions.\nI will also do a visual representation.\nThe ciphers are sometimes called “rotors” because historically they were implemented as a rotating… cipher.\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\n# constants                       #

that rotations can be understood without considering them to be ciphers.\n\n\nFor Enigma\n\nThe Enigma machine triggers rotor rotations every time a letter is encrypted.\nThey rotate as follows\n\nBefore a letter is encryped, the fast rotor rotates forward once.\n\nSo before the first encryption,\n\n(n = 0 : A-&gt;A) becomes (n = 1 : A-&gt;B) before the fast rotor.\n\nTo understand this, the rotation must be applied at two points:\n\nBefore and after going through the fast rotor, and\nBefore and after reversing through the fast^-1 rotor.\n\n\nIf the fast rotor “loops back” from a rotation from (n = 25 : A-&gt;Z) to a non-rotation of (n = 26 = 0 : A-&gt;A).\n\nThe medium rotor advances once, from e.g. (n = 0 : A-&gt;A) to (n = 1 : A-&gt;B)\n\nWhen medium loops back, slow advances once.\nThere are no rotations related to the reflector.\n\nWe image we have typed 29 letters:\n\nthe fast rotor has progressed 29 times and progresses once more before encryption.\n\nSo shift by n = 30, or n = 30-26 = 4.\n\nthe medium rotor progresed 1 time,\nand slow rotor progressed not at all.\n\nSteps labelled “adjust” are not computational\n\nI change horizontal alignment of letters

strings.\n\nThere are instead things called char *\nSay “character star”\nWe attach the * to the variable name\n\nWe’ll revisit this latter - it will make sense.\n\nThat is, an array, or buffer, of characters\n\nNot quite a list - closer to a NumPy array.\n\n\nIt matters what things are called.\n\nIn C we must say what kind of thing a variable is when we “declare” the variable.\nLatter we use the variable, without specifying the kind of thing\nBut we cannot change its kind.\nC variable declaration is like Python function declaration, with def\n\nWe will use format print and variable declarations to introduce “char *”\n\nWe note that Python print appends a newline and C printf does not.\n\nI specify an non-newline terminator in Python for equivalence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntest.py\n\nx =

line.\n\n\n1hello world\n\nYou can update “hello.c” to use a format print.\n\nThis will form the basis of output in this assignment.\n\n\n\n\nenigma.c\n\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main() {\n    char *str = \"hello, world\";\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", str);\n    return 0 ;\n}\n\n\n\nConstants\n\nThe C language has a formal support for constants\n\nThese are values that a fixed when the executable is created.\nThey may not be reassigned by any line of code.\n\nThe #define “pre-processor directive” is used to create constants.\n\n#define is like #include which is somewhat like import\nIt defines new values, which are not variables, for use in the .c file\nThe pre-processor reads .c files before the executable is created.\n\nWe can also use #define for strings, such as the rotor strings.\n\nBy convention, constants, are named in all caps, like ROTORS\nI used a single string of all rotors concatenated.\nYou may do whatever works for you.\n\n\n\n\nenigma.c\n\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\n#define STR \"hello, world\"\n\nint main() {\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", STR);\n    return 0 ;\n}\n\n\nAn astute learner will note that constants need not be computed within an executable.\nIt is not uncommon to compute constants in a different file, or even in a different language.\n\nMy ROTORS constant was computed in Python.\nI used Python file operations to save this computation to “enigma.c”\nVia vim I used the “yank” and “paste” features to move it to the top of “enigma.c”.\n\n\n\n\nJust a little bit\n\nIn C, characters aren’t printing characters.\n\nThey are “just bits” - a collection of ones and zeroes, or a number.\nWe attach the * to the variable name\n\nWe’ll revisit this latter - it will make sense.\n\nThis differs from Python, which uses strings of length one.\n\nThis is sketchy, sometimes.\nStrings are a non-numeric.\n\n\nIf we want to use a numerical value as a printing character, we use a format print.\nC characters use single quotes, and C strings use double quotes.\n\n\n\n\n\ntest.py\n\nx = ord('A')\nprint(f\"{x:d}, {x:x}, {x:c}\")\n\n\n\n\ntest.c\n\n/* We do not use anything like ord() */\nprintf(\"%d, %x, %c\\n\", 'A','A','A');\n\n\n\n\nBoth have the same output:\n\nThe decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base 16), and unicode/ascii representations of the same value.\n\n\n65, 41, A\n\nAn astute learner will note that this insight is sufficient to implement a rotor.\n\n\n\n\n\nC loop Show\n\n\nBuilding Character\n\nThe core complication of the Enigma machine was that it was an iterative cipher.\nLet’s practice iteration by iterating over a char *\nWe note:\n\nIn C there is no string, list, tuple, generator, dictionary, or set type.\nIn Python, for loops require one of these types.\nHenceforth we refer to the C for loop as a “for loop” and Python for loop as a “for each loop”.\n\nA for loop is composed of three components:\n\nInitiate\nTerminate\nIterate\n\nSyntactically, they are structured follows:\n\nfor ( 𝘪𝘯𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘢𝘵𝘦; 𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘦; 𝘪𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘦) { \n    𝘤𝘰𝘥𝘦 𝘣𝘭𝘰𝘤𝘬\n}\n\nPrint 0 through 9\n\nint i ;\nfor ( i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { \n    printf(\"%d\\n\", i);\n}\n\nWe now explore each component.\nAn astute learner will note that this insight is sufficient to implement the entire enigma machine.\n\nRemaining headings provide guidance on common pitfalls.\nIf you can do enigma now, skip to “C args”\n\n\n\nIterate\n\nThe last of the three for loop components, the iterator, is closest to the Python for each loop.\nThe iterator statement is run each time the loop completes, after the internal code block is run.\nAny statement may be placed in this position.\nThe most common is i++, a special shorthand for incrementation.\n\nIt is logically equivalent to Python i += 1.\n\nFind the length of the first word in a string with an iterator only:\n\nIncrease a string index by one within the iterator.\nInclude an if statement in the for loop code block.\nUse a return statement in the if statement code block.\n\n\nchar *str = \"hello world\";\nint i = 0;\nfor ( ; ; i++) {\n        if (str[i] == ' ') {\n                printf(\"%d\\n\", i);\n                return 0;\n        }\n}\n\n\nTerminate\n\nUnlike Python strings, C character arrays have no length.\nRather, they end with a special character.\n\nThis character is called the null terminator\nIt is non-printing (not visible).\nIt is denoted explicitly via '\\0'\n\nSingle quotes to denote a character.\nA backslash “escape” character to denote a special character.\nA zero to denote it is “null”, “zero”, or “nothing”\n\nIt is numerically equal to zero.\n\nUnlike Python booleans, C has no boolean type.\n\nRather it has truthiness, akin to Python if statements with numerical conditions.\nThe numerical value zero is false.\nAll other numerical values are true.\n\nThe termination statement causes the loop to end when it is equal to zero.\nFind the length of the first word in a string with a terminator only:\n\nCheck if a character is the null terminator in the termination statement.\nInclude an incrementation in the for loop code block.\n\n\nchar *str = \"hello world\";\nint i = 0;\nfor ( ; str[i] ; ) {\n        i++;\n}\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", i);\nreturn 0;\n\nThis is also a good example of how sometimes the C for loop may have no code block.\n\nHere is a logically equivalent way to measure the length of a char * serving as a string.\n\n\nchar *str = \"hello world\";\nint i = 0;\nfor ( ; str[i] ; i++ ) { }\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", i);\nreturn 0;\n\nThis is also a good chance to test what order the terminator and iterator are checked.\n\nThe terminator is checked before the iterator.\nThe iterator does not if the terminator is true.\n\nThis matters a lot in this case, where the length calculated would be off by one.\n\n12 instead of 11\nThe value of the iteration variable i is increased the same time the terminator is checked.\nSo the null terminator is at index 11 but this C code would print the numerical value 12.\n\n\nchar *str = \"hello world\";\nint i = 0;\nfor ( ; str[i++] ; ) { }\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", i);\nreturn 0;\n\n\nInitiate\n\nThe initiator allows setting a variable to a certain value before beginning a loop.\nI mostly use it when I have more than one loop, and want to use i for both.\nHere is the above example, with an iniatiator.\n\nchar *str = \"hello world\";\nint i ;\nfor ( i = 0; str[i++] ; ) { }\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", i);\nreturn 0;\n\nThe following is permissable in all modern forms of C, but was not an initial feature of the language.\n\nAs a rule, I try not to declare variables in the initializer so my code works on older devices.\nIt also makes writing a C compiler easier, if you ever plan to do that.\n\n\nchar *str = \"hello world\";\nfor ( int i = 0; str[i++] ; ) { }\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", i);\nreturn 0;\n\n\n\n\n\nArrays Show\n\n\nCollections\n\nC lacks any collection type (list, set, tuple, string)\n\nnotation is used instead\n\ndenotes the location of a some value\n\nThe type of this value gives its size\nSuccessive values are at successive locations\nThese are memory address.\n\n[] notation may also be used\n\nWe simply include the length within brackets.\n\nWe don’t worry about any of that for now.\nYou will likely want to use a collection on Enigma:\n\nRotor rotations\nRotors themselves\nI don’t know, for fun.\n\nC array notation is very similar to Python set notation, but maintains order\n\nYou are responsible for keeping track of the length.\n\n\nchar carray[5] = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};\nint iarray[5] = {2, 4, 8, 16, 32};\nint i;\nfor (i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {\n    printf(\"%c %d\\n\", carray[i], iarray[i]);\n}\n\nCharacter arrays\n\nUnlike Python, where a list of characters and a string of characters differ.\nIn C, an array of characters and a “string” of characters are identical.\n\nchar carray[5] = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};\nchar string[5] = \"abcde\";\nint i;\nfor (i = 0; i &lt;

__name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n    print(enigma(sys.argv[1]))\n\nThis is roughly equivalent to printing the return result of the enigma function within a function called main.\nThis is close to C, but we don’t haven’t introduced a way to use command line arguments.\nLet’s look at a minimal Python example.\n\n\nPyEcho\n\n\npyecho.py\n\nimport sys\nprint(sys.argv[1])\n\n\nWe use as follows:\n\npython3 pyecho.py \"hello world\"\n\nWe can construct the same within C.\n\n\n\nCEcho\n\nThe Python sys module contains many features present by default in a systems programming language.\nOne such is argv, a vector (in the mathematical sense) of arguments.\n\nThese are command line arguments.\nIn Python a list of strings\nIn C an array of char *\nThe zeroth argument is the name of the Python script or C executable\n\nThere is additionally something called argc, an integer count of arguments.\n\nIn C this is needed to know the length of the vector\nIn Python it is redundant, but potentially useful\n\nWe have thus far written main with no arguments, so we also introduce how to write functions with arguments.\n\nC function arguments are identical to Python function arguments\nAs with other variables, C function argument variables must be declared with a type\nUsing functions will make writing C much easier.\n\n\n\n\ncecho.c\n\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", argv[1]);\n        return 0;\n}\n\n\nYou may wish to compile then try the following:\n\ngcc cecho.c -o cecho\n\nNo arguments, which gives a segmentation fault, a type of error when you try to read something that doesn’t exist\n\n./cecho\n\nOne argument, which is printed.\n\n./cecho hello\n\nTwo argument, of which one is printed.\n\n./cecho hello world\n\nTwo words as a single argument using quotes.\n\n./cecho \"hello world\"\n\nYou may note that Python has all the same features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTester Show\n\n\nPodman\n\nI am providing the following Containerfile, which will serve as a minimal autograder\n\nIt sets up an Alpine container.\nIt downloads a Python script to test.\nIt copies in “enigma.c” from your system.\n\n\n\n\nContainerfile\n\nFROM alpine\n\nRUN apk add gcc libc-dev python3 curl\n\nRUN curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cd-c89/crypto/main/enigma/tester.py -o tester.py\n\nCOPY enigma.c .\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nI built my container via:\n\npodman build -t tester .\n\nI tested my code via:\n\npodman run tester python3 tester.py\n\nIf the above script returns “Perfect!” you are done.\n\nCreate a Gist with an “enigma.c”.\nEmail me the url of your Gist, it will look something like, from your official school email:\n\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/cd-public/a840e95e71ac7309a53ab0bb1282ba40\n\nI will review the most recent version prior to the due date.\n\n\n\nVim trick:\n\nYou will probably want to work in a container with vim and also test your code in the same container.\n\nIt is possible to create a second command line tab that is also within the container.\n\nConsult podman documentation - many ways to do this.\n\nI recommend using vim built-in :term command, which splits the screen into a vim editor and a vim terminal.\nYou can move between windows using ctrl+w - if it doesn’t work, Google it.\n\n\n\n\nPodman trick:\n\nYou will probably want to create one container then work in that container until you finish.\npodman run will create a new container each time, which is not what you probably want.\nThe following recycles the previous container, mostly.\n\nRead more: Stack Overflow\n\n\npodman start -a -i `podman ps -q -l`"
