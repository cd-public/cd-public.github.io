<h2>Announcements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Welcome to DATA-599: Cloud Computing!</li>
<li>Applying Spark.
<li>HW7, the translation assignment, is due right now.
<li>HW7 will be to finish the in-class Spark assignment today
<li>HW8 will be to finish the in-class Spark assignment today<ul><li>I think it may seem relatively involved (we'll see)<ul>

<h2>Today</h2>
<ul>
<li>Big Idea: NLP, to sell Spark as the "one stop shop" of cloud computing
<ul>
<li>Spark has built in support for most forms of big computation
<li>Works well under a variety of interfaces
<ul>
<li>Docker
<li>Dataproc
<li>Colab
</ul></ul></ul><br>

    <h2>NLP</h2>
	<h4>Natural Language Processing</h4>
    <ul>
	<li>Natural language processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence.
	<li>It is primarily concerned with providing computers the ability to process data encoded in natural language and is thus closely related to information retrieval, knowledge representation and computational linguistics, a subfield of linguistics.
	<li>Typically data is collected in text corpora, using either rule-based, statistical or neural-based approaches of machine learning and deep learning. 
	<li>Major tasks in natural language processing are speech recognition, text classification, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation. 
	</ul>
	<p>Also: I wanted to teach an NLP class this term :P

<h2>Syntax</h2>
<ul style="width:100%"><li>Syntax concerns the proper ordering of words and its affect on meaning.<ul>
<li>The dog bit the cat.
<li>The cat bit the dog.
<li>The dog the cat bit.
<li>Bit cat dog the the.

<h2>Semantics</h2>
<ul style="width:100%"><li>Semantics concerns the (literal) meaning of words, phrases, and sentences.<ul>
<li>Literally as in "as written"
<li>Perhaps as "denotation" vs "connotation".
<li>We can consider e.g. plant:<ul>
<li>"Plant" as a member species of the eurkaryotes that form the taxonomical kingdom <b>Plantae</b>
<li>"Plant" as a facilty for production, such as a power plant or manufacturing plant.
<li>"Plant" as a stage of the agricultural process.</ul></ul></ul><br>

<h2>Pragmatics</h2>
<ul style="width:100%"><li>Well-formed sentences may be meaningless.<ul>
<li>In HTML:
<code class="HTML"><b><br></b></code>
<li>The famous English example is "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously."
<li>It was coined by Chomsky in 1957.
<li>Since then:<ul>
<li>Technologies have become "green"<ul><li>Hydrogen is a "colorless green" fuel.</ul>
<li>Desktop computers now sleep, and often operate "furiously" when under high compute loads.<ul><li>When I "sleep" my PC after doing distributed computing, it "sleeps furiously".</ul></ul>

<h2>Ambiguity</h2>
<ul ><li>Unsurprisingly a problem with speech recognition.<ul>
<li>"Recognize speech" vs. "wreck a nice beach"
<li>"Save a wretch like me" vs "Sailorish like me"
<li>"Alice in Chains" vs "Allison Chance"</ul></ul><br>

<h2>Best Friend</h2>
<ul><li>Here's a real thing that actually happened in real life.
<ul><li>Saweetie features Doja Cat on "Best Friend"
<li>Saweetie's team pushed music videos transcribing on of Doja's lines as
<blockquote>She off her fish, I said, uh uh don't go there</blockquote>
</ul></ul>

<h2>Best Friend</h2>
<ul><li>Here's a real thing that actually happened in real life.
<ul><li>The original lyric video also mistranscribed this line, but was taken down.
<li>The new lyric video has only ~10M vs 300M views! but has the line as: 
<blockquote>She off her fifth shot, I said, uh uh don't go there</blockquote>

<h2>Best Friend</h2>
<ul><li>Here's a real thing that actually happened in real life.
<ul><li>Doja Cat has since deleted her Twitter but did weigh in on the controvery:
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210406043236/https://twitter.com/DojaCat/status/1353927764684902400"><blockquote>whoever puttin the lyrics of my verse on bestfriend as "she off her fish" needs to get slapped with a size 10 flip flop my guy</blockquote></a>
<li>It's worth noting even the corrected lyrics mistranscibed "mm mm" as "uh uh".
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210408184622/https://twitter.com/DojaCat/status/1353927952145158144"><blockquote>She off her fifth shot, I said, mm mm don't go there</blockquote></a>
</ul></ul>

<h2>Best Friend</h2>
<ul><li>Here's a real thing that actually happened in real life.
<ul><li>It's worth noting there were some fairly advanced lyrics in Best Friend.<UL>
<li>Saweetie slant rhymes "bestie" with Tesla
<li>Saweetie says Doja "looks good(t) with a 't' at the end"
<li>Doja does wordplay "ain't dumb but she my tweedledee"
</ul>
<li>So probably the AIs aren't doing too well on this, but you would expect the Saweetie/Doja team to get the phonology correct!

<h2>Case Explosion</h2>
<ul style="width:70%"><li>Syntactic Ambiguity compounds rapidly.
<li>We consider the case of adposition (prepositional) phrases<ul>
<li>The cannonical adposition phrase is:
<blockquote>The quick brown fox jumps <b>over the lazy dog</b>,</blockquote>
<li>It consists of an adposition ('over') and a noun phrase ('the lazy dog')
<li>A minimal example would be:
<blockquote>I go <b>to class</b>.</blockquote>
<li>It consists of an adposition ('to') and a noun phrase ('class')
<li>'to' and 'over' are <b>pre</b>positions - prefix operators on noun phrases.
<li>There also ambipositions and circumpositions...<ul>
<li>Ambi: The term 'notwithstanding' with 'concerns' before or after. 
<li>Circum: 'from * on' supports most time and place noun phrases.</ul>
<li>English has loan inpositions (like '+') such as <em>magna <b>cum</b> laude</em>.
<li>Dubiously non-standard English via prepospition stranding has postpositions.
<blockquote>I don't know <b>where from</b>.</blockquote>

<li>Check them out:
<code class="python">>>> {n:catalan(n) for n in range(1,11)}

<h2>Ambiguity</h2>
<ul ><li>Speach recognition<ul>
<li>Why is Language Ambiguous?</ul>
<li>Unique expressions would be large and difficult to communicate.<ul>
<li>Most arrangements convey no useful meaning.</ul>
<li>Resolvable ambiguity compresses information/data.
<li>Language is "naturally occuring" and ambiguity emerged incidentally.
<li>Sometimes this leads to problems. Oh well.<ul>
<li>For computers, it leads to big problems.

<section>
  <h2>Word Segmentation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Breaking a string of characters into a sequence of words.</li>
    <li>In some written languages (e.g. Chinese) words are not separated by spaces.</li>
    <li>Even in English, characters other than white-space can be used to separate words [e.g. , ; . - : ( ) ]</li>
    <li>Examples from English URLs:<ul>
    <li>jumptheshark.com -> jump the shark .com</li>
    <li>myspace.com/pluckerswingbar -> myspace .com pluckers wing bar</li>
    <li>myspace.com/pluckerswingbar -> myspace .com plucker swing bar</li></ul>
	<li>A personal favorite: The Freakybuttrue Peculiarium and Museum<br>
	<img width="30%" src="https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-8hmyg03dat/images/stencil/1737w/carousel/30/Exterior_shop.jpg">
	<ul><li>I parsed as "Freaky but true"
	<li>A colleague parsed as "Freaky butt rue"
	<li>Hilarity ensued, etc. (I was correct we checked).
  </ul>

  <h2>Morphological Analysis</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A morpheme is the smallest linguistic unit that has semantic meaning </li><ul>
    <li>e.g. “carry”, “pre”, “ed”, “ly”, “s”</li></ul>
    <li>Morphological analysis is the task of segmenting a word into its morphemes:<ul>
    <li>carried -> carry + ed (past tense)</li>
    <li>independently -> in + (depend + ent) + ly</li>
    <li>Googlers -> (Google + er) + s (plural)</li>
    <li>unlockable -?> un + (lock + able) : (un + lock) + able</li></ul>
	<li>In English: words are not atomic.
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Part Of Speech (POS) Tagging</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Annotate each word in a sentence with a part-of-speech.</li>
    <li>Useful for subsequent syntactic parsing and word sense disambiguation.</li>
<table border="1">

  <h2>Phrase Chunking</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Find all non-recursive noun phrases (NPs) and verb phrases (VPs) in a sentence.</li>
	<ul><li>Not just done in natural languages!
	<li>Done with HTML!
	<li>A 'non-recursive phrase' is textual content with no internal HTML elements.
	</ul>In English:
<ul>
  <li>
    [NP <span style="color:red;">I</span>] 
    [VP <span style="color:green;">ate</span>] 
    [NP <span style="color:red;">the spaghetti</span>] 
    [PP <span style="color:blue;">with</span>] 
    [NP <span style="color:red;">meatballs.</span>]
  </li>
  <li>
    [NP <span style="color:red;">He</span>] 
    [VP <span style="color:green;">reckons</span>] 
    [NP <span style="color:red;">the current account deficit</span>]

    <li>Words in natural language usually have a fair number of different possible meanings.<ul>
    <li>We may have a lot of interest in computational linguistics.</li>
    <li>We may have a lot of interest on a debt of some kind.</li></ul>
    <li>For many tasks (question answering, translation), the proper sense of each ambiguous word in a sentence must be determined.</li>

</ul>
    <li>Also referred to a “case role analysis,” “thematic analysis,” and “shallow semantic parsing”</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Semantic Parsing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A semantic parser maps a natural-language sentence to a complete, detailed semantic representation (logical form).</li>
    <li>For many applications, the desired output is immediately executable by another program.</li>
    <li>Example: Mapping an English database query to Prolog:</li>
    <li>How many cities are there in the US?</li>
	<code class="prolog">  answer(A, 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;count(B, 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(city(B), 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loc(B, C), 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const(C, countryid(USA))), 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A))
</code>
  </ul>
  <p>I don't know Prolog, I just hear this is correct.
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Textual Entailment</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Determine whether one natural language sentence entails (implies) another under an ordinary interpretation.</li>
    <li>E.g., “US Womens are playing in the world cup. -> Some women are playing a sport.”</li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Pragmatics/Discourse Tasks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Anaphora Resolution/Co-Reference</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Determine which phrases in a document refer to the same underlying entity.</li><ul>
      <li>I put the carrot on the plate and ate it.<ul>
	  <li>Did I eat the plate?</ul>
      <li>Biden supports Netanyahu. But the head of government cannot act without the legislature.<ul>
	  <li>Who is the head of government?</ul> </ul> 
      <li>Some cases require difficult reasoning, a famous example:<ul>
      <li>Today was Jack's birthday. Penny and Janet went to the store. They were going to get presents. Janet decided to get a kite. "Don't do that," said Penny. "Jack has a kite. He will make you take it back."</li>
    </ul></ul></ul>
	<p>Really hard when moving across domans e.g. ask synthetic chemists about experiments.

    <li>Article:</ul></ul><br>
	<span style="font-size:8px;line-height:.1">On 9 June 2024, following the results of the 2024 European Parliament elections in which his centrist grouping received only 14.6% of the votes, finishing nearly 17 points behind Le Pen's RN party, Macron unexpectedly dissolved the National Assembly and called for an early legislative election to be held on 30 June and 7 July 2024.[303]

In the first round of the election, on 30 June, Macron's grouping received only 20.04% of the votes nationwide, placing third well behind the hard-right RN (33.15%) and the left-wing NFP alliance (27.99%), which constituted the worst electoral performance for a governing coalition in a general election since the start of the modern French Republic in 1870.[304] Exit polls released shortly after 8pm on 30 June suggested the RN-led alliance was on course to win either a plurality of seats or an outright majority in the second round, while Macron's coalition was set to lose at least half of the seats it won in 2022.[305]

In the second round, on 7 July, Macron was handed another hung parliament with the left-wing coalition unexpectedly winning a plurality of seats though 90 to 100 seats short of an overall majority, leaving the left theoretically unable to form a government on its own. Macron's grouping lost both 86 seats and its status as the largest parliamentary bloc while the RN-led alliance, though dramatically underperforming the polls, still managed to make significant gains, eventually becoming the largest single party in the new National Assembly. The results presented unprecedented potential for political crisis and parliamentary gridlock.[306]
17th National Assembly of France, elected in 2024.

Shortly after exit polls were released on the night of 7 July, Macron's Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, announced he would tender his resignation to the President. The following day, Macron refused Attal's resignation, instead asking him to stay on until a new government can be formed.</span>
    <li>Summary: In mid-2024, Macron's centrist coalition placed third in French legislative elections, leading to a hung parliament. Macron retained his Prime Minister and started forming a new government amidst political uncertainty.</li>

<section >
<h2>Sapir-Whorf</h2>
<ul ><li>Strong vs. Weak
<li>Láadan and Butler
<li>Scientific Method
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Strong form</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The strong form of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is <strong>linguistic determinism</strong>
	  <ul><li>Language determines thought
	  <li>Linguistic categories limit and shape cognitive processes
	  <li>Speakers of different languages perceive and conceptualize the world differently based on the linguistic structures available to them.
	  <li>Language not only influences but also determines how individuals think and perceive reality.
	</ul></ul>
	<p>Generally regarded as disproven (I disagree but am in a minority).

</section>
<section>
  <h2>Weak form</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The weak form of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is <strong>linguistic relativity</strong><ul>
	  <li>Language influences but does not determine thought
	  <li>Language influences the ways in which individuals perceive and categorize experiences. 
	  <li>This perspective allows for cognitive universals across languages
	  <li>This acknowledges that language can affect thinking patterns and cognitive processes.
    </li>
	<p>Generally regarded as proven, as least as usually defined.
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Weak Example</h2>
<ul><li>A new bridge in 2004:
<blockquote>When the Viaduct de Millau opened in the south of France in 2004, this tallest bridge in the world won worldwide accolades. German newspapers described how it "floated above the clouds" with "elegance and lightness" and "breathtaking" beauty. In France, papers praised the "immense" "concrete giant." Was it mere coincidence that the Germans saw beauty where the French saw heft and power? Lera Boroditsky thinks not.</blockquote>
<li>Newsweek claims:
<blockquote>In German, the noun for bridge, Brücke, is feminine. In French, pont is masculine. German speakers saw prototypically female features; French speakers, masculine ones.</blockquote>

  <h2>Language Láadan</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Láadan is a constructed language created by linguist Suzette Haden Elgin in 1982. 
    <li>It was designed specifically to explore the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, particularly its feminist implications.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Key Features:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Feminist Linguistics:</strong> Láadan was developed with the intention of expressing the experiences and perspectives of women more fully than natural languages do, reflecting a feminist critique of linguistic and cultural norms.</li>
        <li><strong>Emphasis on Emotions:</strong> Láadan includes words and grammatical structures that emphasize emotional expression and communication, which are sometimes considered more nuanced than in natural languages.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
	<li>According to Elgin, this is designed to counter male-centered language's limitations on women, who are forced to respond "I know I said that, but I meant this". 
  </ul>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Language Láadan</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Read Suzette Hadan Elgin on Láadan <a href="https://www.sfwa.org/members/elgin/Laadan.html">here</a>.
	  <blockquote>Nevertheless, there's a theory that women are distressed because existing human languages are inadequate to express their perceptions; if that theory has any validity, it would seem that women would welcome a language that better served that purpose.</blockquote>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Judith Butler</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Judith Butler, a philosopher and gender theorist, introduced the concept of gender performativity in their work "Gender Trouble" (1990). 
	  <li>Gender is not an inherent or static identity but rather a social and linguistic construct that is performed and reiterated through language and other social practices.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Key Aspects:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performativity:</strong> Butler argues that gender is enacted and performed repeatedly through speech acts, gestures, and other everyday actions. These performances create and reinforce gender identities within social contexts.</li>
        <li><strong>Language as Constitutive:</strong> Language plays a crucial role in the construction of gender identities by prescribing and regulating norms of speech, behavior, and appearance that are associated with specific genders.</li>
        <li><strong>Critique of Essentialism:</strong> Butler's theory challenges essentialist views of gender, which posit that gender identities are natural or biologically determined. Instead, they argues for understanding gender as a dynamic and contingent product of social interactions and linguistic practices.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
	<li>When ChatGPT formatted these slides from text to HTML, it changed Butler's pronouns (I corrected them back I hope).
	<li>My takeaway: Language constructs gender, a minimum in part.
  </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Talking about subject/object and pronouns at the same time is very interesting. Why?
		<li>My training: binary gendered personal pronouns are:
		<ul><li>Masculine: He/him/his
