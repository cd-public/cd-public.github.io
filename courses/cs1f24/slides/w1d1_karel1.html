<h2>Background</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Thesis Title</dt>
<dd>Mining Secure Behavior of Hardware Designs
</dd>
<dt>Plain English</dt>
<dd>Just as there are bugs in code that makes <b>software</b>, modern <b>hardware</b> is also written in code and therefore may contain bugs. I find these bugs.
</dd>
<dt>Thesis</dt>
<dd>Specification mining can discover properties that can be used to verify the secure
behavior of closed source CISC CPU designs, properties that can be used to verify
the temporal correctness of CPU designs, and hyperproperties that can be used to
verify that modules, SoCs, and CPUs have secure information flow.

</section>

<section>
<h2>Sections</h2>
<ul>
<li >Everyone will be placed into small sections of 8-10 students, with one section leader</li>
<li >All section leaders are students who recently took and excelled in this course</li>
<li >Will meet as a group with your section leader once a week for an hour to go over and work on problems
<ul>
<li >These meetings will be on Wednesdays or Thursdays</li>
<li >Poll out <strong>today</strong>, finalize by Friday.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Section leaders will also serve as a secondary source you can ask for help or guidance from throughout the week
<ul>
<li >This tutoring is part of their job! Don’t hesitateto ask them for some extra assistance!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Planning to start section meetings <em>next</em> week</li>
<blockquote>Small sections are mandatory. They help you, and your attendance helps your peers. As a result, we have a policy for attendance. Every unexcused absence after the third will result in a 5% deduction, per absence, to your final grade. If you cannot attend your section, reach out and we will place you in a section at another time.</blockquote>
</section>


<section>
<h2>Academic Honesty</h2>
<ul>
<li >You must write your code yourself.
<ul>
<li>You may "use" AIs like ChatGPT, Gemini, to "write" your code. They are okay at it, but not great.
<ul><li>You must cite what you used with the prompt, both for honesty and so I can provide feedback.</li></ul>
<li>You may collaborate with your peers but may not copy their work.
<ul><li>Peer collaboration requires enthusiastic consent by all parties.</li>
<li>You must say who you worked with, again to help me understand how to provide feedback.</li></ul>
<li>You may use online communities, most like Stack Overflow and GeeksforGeeks
<ul><li>In fact, you should. They are better than the AIs, and learning to use them is more rewarding.
<li>Do not copy solutions from these sites, use them to learn how to solve a problem then write yourself.
<li>Please cite - I want you to learn to use these and will often have suggestions.
</ul>
<li>Dishonesty is when you take work (code) someone else did and claim you did yourself.

<h2>Citation</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Professor Jed Rembold did most of the work to make these slides.
<li>If you see him around ask him:
<blockquote>What is the square root of <em>E</em> over <em>m</em>?</blockquote>
<li>(He was recently in the Washington Post for proving some of Einstein's work - fun!)

<h2>Speaking of Code</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Python: It's the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages">real deal</a>.
<ul>
<li>Python is my favorite to express ideas by typing
<li>It has notable advantage over unformated text or prose.
<li>Like speaking, writing, or typing it has a learning curve.
<li>Like speaking, writing, or typing, once I learned it I used it alot.
</ul>
<li>We start this class with a subset of Python called "Karel".
<ul><li>This reminds me typing of while I had to look at the keyboard.
</ul>

<h2>Karel</h2>
<ul>
<li>Imagine a robot on flat surface, like my robot vacuum.
<ul><li>The robot 'eats' socks and then needs rescued.</ul>

<li>We assume the world is a grid.
<li>Karel as a a few actions:
<ul>
<li>Can move forward one space</li>
<li>Can turn left 90 degrees (just like NASCAR 🏎️)</li>
<li>Can pick up a 'beeper'</li>
<li>Can drop off a 'beeper'</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We will be spending the first several class days getting Karel to solve a wide
variety of problems
<ul>
<li>This content is not in your book, but more in-depth descriptions can
be found <a href="https://willamette.edu/~esroberts/pykarel/reader/01-IntroducingKarel.html">here</a>

</ul><li>We imagine a (very simplified) map as like so.
<li>Take a moment to write out how to move, and left-turn, to get to the delicious gatorque.
