                    <h2>Problems:</h2>
                    <h3>Problem 1: Karel Checkerboard</h3>
					<p>We imagine Karel:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Begins in the bottom left corner, facing toward the right.
                        <li>Wishes to place a beeper on half of squares.
                        <li>Wishes no beepers to be on squares with a beeper immediately above, below, left, or right.
                        <ul>
                            <li>We term this the "checkboard" pattern.
                        </ul>
                    </ol>
                    <center><img width="100%" src="imgs/ps2_1.png"></center>
                    <p>Make sure you your program works on the following grid sizes:
                    <table style="width:100%">
                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td>8x8
                                <td>1x8
                                <td>5x3
                                <td>5x5
                                <td>8x1
                             </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                    <p>Karel may end anywhere on the grid but should not end with an error. There are always two acceptbale checkerboard patterns (bottom left has, or does not have, a beeper).
                    <h4>How I solved Problem 1</h4>
                    <p><b>If/else, a special case of if, was covered minimally in class, but of great use here.</b> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-if-else/">Read more.</a> My solution contained around 32 lines of Python (.py) excluding comments. I utilized four functions in addition to main() and three optional functions. I used one 'for', one 'while', and two 'if/else' statements. 
                    <p>I did <em>not</em> successfully complete the task on my first attempt, but solution worked when I added appropriate 'else' branches to my 'if/else' statements.

                    <h3>Problem 2: <code>divisible_by_six_or_seven</code></h3>
					<p>Prob2.py contains a few lines under a comment named "boilerplate" that allow you test your code, but is otherwise mostly empty. Write your solution as specified above this "boilerplate" which you are encouraged to leave unaltered.
                    <p>Write a function called <code>divisible_by_six_or_seven</code>, that
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>divisible_by_six_or_seven</code> accepts two arguments: a smaller integer value that I will call <code>x</code> and a larger integer value, that I will call <code>y</code>.
                        <li><code>divisible_by_six_or_seven</code> prints every number...
                        <ul>
                            <li>from <code>x</code> to <code>y</code>, including <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, 
                            <li>that is divisible by six (6) or seven (7), but 
                            <li>not divisble by both six (6) and seven (7).
                        </ul>
                        <li><code>divisible_by_six_or_seven</code> may print these numbers <b>in any order</b>
                        <li><code>divisible_by_six_or_seven</code>, after printing all the numbers, will <b>return</b> (<em>not</em> print) how many numbers were printed.
                    </ul>
                    <p>I have written a small web application to help you. It allows you to input two values, and see the expected "print" and "return" results. <a href="ps2_prob2.html">Link</a>.
                    <h4>How I solved Problem 2</h4>
                    <p>I used one 'for' loop over a range created by the 'range()' function, similar to Karel 'for' loops. Within this loop, I used a series of 'if' statements, modulo '%' operations, and comparisons to zero using double equals '=='. Within the 'if' statements, I printed values and also increased the value of a counting variable, which I would latter return. There are many ways to structure these statements, and you should do what makes the most sense for you.
                    <p>I was able to complete this task on my first attempt, but it took many tests before I convinced myself that it was correct. Also, I wrote the helper demonstration before attempting this task, and I took several attempts (at least 3) to create the code for demonstration.
                    <h4>Extra Credit</h4>
                    <p>I have discovered a solution that requires a single line of code - that is, my Prob2.py takes only one line. I used a list comprehension and a lambda expression to achieve this.
                    <p>Any student able to write, and explain, a single-line solution to Problem 2 will receive up one assignment worth of extra credit. The explanation is required because I believe generative AI programs may be able to solve this question quite easily, but I am doubtful you will be able to explain the code that they write. And if you can explain the code, then it doesn't matter that an AI wrote it.
                    <p>If you would like to attempt this extra credit assignment, submit your single-line solution and schedule a time to meet with me to convince me you understand it.

                    <h3>Problem 3: Squares</h3>
                    <p><b>You do not need to write code for Problem 3</b>
					<p>Prob3.txt is a text (.txt) file and not a Python (.py) file. That is because Problem 3 is a writing problem: write out in prose, as if you are speaking to me, how you would solve the following problem.
                    <p>Consider two squares.
                    <ul>
                        <li>One square of side length <code>A</code> that is greater than zero (0)<br><code>A > 0</code>
                        <li>One square of side length <code>B</code> that is greater than zero (0)<br><code>B > 0</code>
                        <li>They overlap by a distance <code>d</code> greater or equal to zero (0) and less than or equal to <code>A</code><br><code>0 &leq; d &leq; A</code>
                        <li>We imagine the square are lined up horizontally (left-to-right) on the bottom and overlap horizontally (left-to-right).
                    </ul>
                    <p>We ask you to find the total area covered by both squares, without counting overlapping area twice.
                    <p>If <code>d</code> is equal to 0, then the total area is equal to <code>A * A + B * B</code>
                    <p>If <code>d</code> is equal to <code>A</code>, then the total area is equal to the larger of <code>A * A</code> or <code>B * B</code>
                    <p>I have written a small web application to help you. It allows you to input three values, and see the expected area. <a href="ps2_prob3.html">Link</a>.
                    <p><b>You do not need to write code for Problem 3</b>
                    <h4>Hints</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You just need the shaded area, so be careful you don’t “double count” the overlapping region.
                        <li>You don’t know which square is larger, so you may need your algorithm to adjust depending on the inputs.
                        <li>It might be useful to map out the major possible configurations to ensure your algorithm works for all of them.
                    </ul>
