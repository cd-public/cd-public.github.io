## Motivations
- The field of computing today is scarcely recognizable compared to the field 50 years ago.
- Many feel the pace of the field is only accelerating as we move forwards.
- Studying computing now lets you take part in driving forward not only the field of computing, but of all the modern fields with utilize computing.
	- Almost all fields!

---

## Squad Goals
::: {.block name="Primary Objective"}
To gain the skills, knowledge, and confidence necessary to write, test, and debug Python programs requiring several hundred lines of code.
:::

Doing so will require that students be able to:

- implement simple algorithms using Python control structures,
- apply decomposition and step-wise refinement techniques,
- make effective use of recursing computing strategies,
- design data structures to model information,
- execute all phases of the programming process, including design, implementation, testing and debugging,
- and defend the argument that computer science is far more than just programming.

---

## Grading
- Standard 90/80/70 etc grade cut-offs
	- Top 2% get +'s, bottom 2% get -'s

------------- ----------
Participation         5%
Problem Sets         15%
Projects             25%
Lab                  10%
Midterm              20%
Final Exam           25%
------------- ----------

---

## Participation
- Scored through participation in class polls or in contacting me with a question about a specific slide.
- Generally 1-2 polls per day
- Answering any poll gets you full points for the day (even if you are wrong!)
- Answering correctly gets you bits of extra credit
- Polling website at [http://rembold-class.ddns.net](http://rembold-class.ddns.net)
- Will start officially on Wednesday

---

## Homework
- Falls into two categories:
	- _Problem Sets:_ smaller, more focused assignments
		- Graded on standard, numeric scales
	- _Projects:_ larger, more integrative assignments
		- Graded on a more qualitative scale (next slide)
- All will be due on Sundays at 11:59pm
- Submissions of _both_ will be handled through Github Classroom
	- Learning how to do this is part to today's lab
- 3 cumulative late days over the entire semester without penalty then penalties enacted for each subsequent day late
- Extensions for any reason need to be requested and approved by myself

---

## Project Scoring

------ -----------------
     A submission so good it "makes you weep"
      Exceeds requirements
     Satisfies all assignment requirements
      Meets most requirements, but some issues
     Some more serious problems evident
      Even worse...
     Why even bother turning this in?
------ -----------------

## Labs
- For the most part, we will only have lab on Wednesdays
- You are somewhat split across the sections
- Exercises involving what we discussed in class the previous day
- Many will involve pair programming
- I'll check people off as the finish for your credit
- If you finish early, any remaining time will be your own to work on homework, ask questions, or leave

## Sections
- New pilot program just started last semester!
- Everyone will be placed into small sections of 5-7 students, with one section leader
- All section leaders are students who recently took and excelled in this course
- Will meet as a group with your section leader once a week for an hour to go over and work on problems
	- Figuring these times out, but they will largely be on Monday or Tuesday afternoons and evenings
- Section leaders will also serve as a secondary source you can ask for help or guidance from
- Hopefully starting up next week


## Tests
- Tests are necessary to assure retention of material and ensure that some are not getting too much help on the assignments.
- Just two this semester:
	- Midterm on October 22
	- Final on Dec 17
- Tests will be taken in class and will actually not allow the use of a computer
	- This policy has actually been seen to _improve_ student scores, as it prevents you from wasting tons of time obsessing about a small mistake!
- Example tests and study materials will be given out a week in advance.


## Communication
- I tend to find WISE lacking both from a polish perspective and from an ease of use perspective
- I will be using a 3rd-party forum to focus class communication, announcements, and questions: [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/c/GA23B6ED8/feed)
	- You should have gotten an email with invite instructions. Let me know if you have not!
	- Totally free to sign up and use
- Will be the main online location for announcements and questions and answers.
- Has support for code-blocks when talking about code by surrounding code in triple backticks: \`\`\``this is code` \`\`\`


## Academic Honesty
1. You must not look at solutions or program code that is not your own.
2. You must not share your solution code with other students.
	- But you are welcome (and encouraged!) to work alongside others enroute to finding a solution.
3. You must indicate on your submitted assignment any assistance you received or who you worked alongside.



## Diving In
::: {.columns}
:::: {.column}
- This course is an introduction on _computer science_, and covers more than just programming!
- Python is used to teach the programming portion of the course, but the focus is less on Python itself and more on general computer science principles.
- If you come across situations where you need to know a bit more about specific Python details, there are plenty of resources online, or just ask me!

## Effective Communication
::: incremental
- To communicate effectively with someone or something, you really need two layers of communication:
	- A shared language or method of conveying information 
		- French, for instance
		- In our case, Python
	- A joint agreement about what constitutes meaning and ways to limit confusion or misunderstanding
		- Being able to explain things clearly and unambiguously
:::

## Giving Clear Instructions
- We will initially make the language _extremely_ simple so that we can focus on the second layer
- Karel the Robot exists in a very simple 2D world
- Has a very limited set of actions:
	- Can move forward one space
	- Can rotate counter-clockwise (turn left) 90 degrees
	- Can pick up a beeper
	- Can drop off a beeper
- We will be spending the first several class days just interested in how we can take these simple instructions and get Karel to solve a wide variety of problems
	- This content is not in your book, but more in-depth descriptions can be found [here](https://willamette.edu/~esroberts/pykarel/reader/01-IntroducingKarel.html)

## The World
::::::cols
::::col
- Karel's world is defined on a grid
	- _avenues_ run north-south
	- _streets_ run east-west
	- The _intersection_ between a street and avenue is called a corner
- Compass directions are as you'd have them on a map, with North pointing upwards
- Walls are impassable
- Beepers are diamonds
- Karel is a house-shaped polygon
::::

::::col
\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=100%
\draw[MGreen,very thick] (0,0) rectangle +(3,3);
\foreach \x in {0.5,1.5,2.5}{
	\foreach \y in {0.5, 1.5, 2.5}{
		\node[MGreen] at (\x,\y) {+};
	}
}
\foreach[count=\t] \x in {0.5,1.5,2.5} \node[MGreen] at (\x,-0.5) {\t};
\foreach[count=\t] \y in {0.5,1.5,2.5} \node[MGreen] at (-0.5, \y) {\t};

\draw[MGreen, very thick] (3,2) --+(-1,0);
\fill[MBlue] (2.5,0.5)+(0,0.3) --+(-0.3,0) --+(0,-0.3) --+(0.3,0);
\fill[MYellow] (1.5,2.4)+(0,.4)--+(0.25,0.25)--+(0.25,-0.15)--+(-0.25,-0.15)--+(-0.25,0.25);

\end{tikzpicture}

::::
::::::

## Commands
- As we mentioned before, Karel is a simple robot, and can really only do 4 potential actions

 Command | Action
:----|:--------
`move()` | Moves Karel forward one corner in whatever direction they are facing
`turn_left()` | Rotates Karel 90 deg counter-clockwise
`pick_beeper()` | Picks up a beeper on the ground
`put_beeper()` | Places a beeper on the ground

- Our commands are just sequences of these actions

## Example
::::::cols
::::col
- Suppose we had the situation to the right and wanted to navigate to the beeper, pick it up, and then drop it at the corner of 1st avenue and 1st street.
- Take a moment to write out your instructions.
	- Remember you can only move, rotate left, and pick up or drop the beeper
- Note that there are multiple ways to do this! Which is better?
::::

::::col
\begin{tikzpicture}%%width=100%
\karelgrid[MGreen]{3}{3}

\draw[MGreen, very thick] (3.5,2.5) --+(-1,0) (0.5,1.5) --+ (2,0);
\karelbeeper[MBlue]{3}{1}
\karelmark[MYellow]{1}{3}{0}

\end{tikzpicture}

::::
::::::

## One Solution
```{.python style='max-height:800px'}
def main():
	move()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	move()
	turn_left()
	move()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	move()
	pick_beeper()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	turn_left()
	move()
	move()
	put_beeper()
```

- Katherine Johnson worked as a "computer" at NASA, when the term still referred to humans doing the calculations.
	- One of the three black women portrayed in the 2016 film _Hidden Figures_
	- Awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015
	- Passed away in February of this year at the age of 101

## Data Types
- Generally, the data processed by computers can take on many forms
- A _data type_ defines the common characteristics of some data values that have a certain form or purpose.
	- Ex: a whole number or integer has certain characteristics
- A data type has a _domain_, which is the set of all potential values that would belong to that type.
	- Ex: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...
- A data type has a _set of operations_ that define how those values can be manipulated
	- Ex: You can add two whole numbers (5+2)

## Numeric Types
- Initially, we'll just focus on the numeric types
- Python has 3 data types for numbers:
	- `int`{.python} for integers and whole numbers

		```python
		1, 2, 3, 10, 1001010101
		```

	- `float`{.python} for numbers containing a decimal point

		```python
		1.23, 3.14, 10.001, 0.0
		```

	- `complex`{.python} for numbers with an imaginary component (which we won't deal with)

---

## Expressions
- Like most languages, Python describes computation using _arithmetic expressions_, which consist of _terms_ joined by _operators_
	- Very similar to how a logical English sentence has nouns connected by verbs
- A term in an expression can be:
	- an explicit numeric value (1 or 3.14)
	- a variable name serving as a placeholder to a value
	- a value resulting from the output of a function call
	- another expression enclosed in parentheses
- Operators are mostly the common ones found from arithmetic, but with a few extras, as we'll see on the next slide
- The result of an expression will have a data type that generally depends on both the operation done and the input data types

---

## Integer and Float Operations
- `i + j`  the _sum_ of `i` and `j`[留]{.orange}
- `i - j`  the _difference_ between `i` and `j`[留]{.orange}
- `i * j`  the _product_ of `i` and `j`[留]{.orange}
- `i // j`  the _floor division_ of `i` by `j`[留]{.orange}
- `i / j`  the _division_ of `i` by `j`[†]{.orange}
- `i % j`  the _remainder_ when `i` is divided by `j`[留]{.orange}
- `i ** j`  `i` to the _power_ of `j`[留]{.orange}

<br>
<hr>
<br>
[留]{.orange} -- Returns `int` if both `i` and `j` are integers, `float` otherwise

[†]{.orange} -- Returns `float` always

---

## Order of Operations
- Basic order of operations applies just like in math!
- Operations in parentheses done first
- Without parentheses, order of operations proceeds as:
	- `**` (exponents)
	- `-n` (negative numbers)
	- `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, executed from left to right
	- `+` and `-`, executed from left to right
